 ## Recommendations

 2. Investing in mentorship programs for top-performing sales reps will help scale success across the team
 3. Strengthening top-performing sales channels, like Direct sales, while optimizing underperforming ones, such as Banners and Twitter, will ensure a more efficient sales strategy.
 4. Additionally, expanding customer base within high-value industries such as Technology, Oil & Gas, and Finance in the Northeast can drive further revenue growth.
 5. Lastly, aligning marketing and inventory strategies with seasonal demand trends will maximize revenue opportunities throughout the year.
